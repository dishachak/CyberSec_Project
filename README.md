# CyberSec_Project

We have implemented Network Attack Prediction using different classifiers. 
The CICIDS 2017 dataset have been used to perform a binary classification of predicting attack types using the feature set. 
Different AI/ML models used for classification and the performance of each classifier has been compared using the various metrics.
